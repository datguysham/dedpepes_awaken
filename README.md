Ded Pepes Awaken is a free-and-fair mint collection inscribed on the Fractal Bitcoin network with a total of 666 32x32 sized assets.

## History

Based on the art by **mkong**, this is a derivative of the Ded Pepes CC0 Cursed Collection [@DedPepes](https://x.com/dedpepes). 

The original collection listed on [marketplaces](https://magiceden.io/ordinals/marketplace/dedpepes) is fully made up of inscriptions with negative numbers, ie cursed ordinals.

The images are downloadable from the official [github](https://github.com/DedPepes/CursedDedPepes/tree/main/images) and is free for all to use (ie CC0).

## What is CC0?

[From wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license#Zero,_public_domain):

>Besides copyright licenses, Creative Commons also offers CC0, a tool for relinquishing copyright and releasing material into the public domain. CC0 is a legal tool for waiving as many rights as legally possible.[34] Or, when not legally possible, CC0 acts as fallback as public domain equivalent license

Examples of projects that make use of CC0 licences are:
- CrypToadz.
- CryptoDickButts.
- Goblintown.wtf.
- Mfers.
- Nouns.

## Now

Colors were individually inverted from the original negative image keeping the size of approximately 1kb each the same.

In the spirit of cc0, the **Ded Pepes Awaken** collection will have the similar cc0 license for usage.

Minting was done on [inscribenow.io](https://fractal.inscribenow.io/collections/69bd65c3aefcf514) once Block 21000 of the Fractal network is crossed, on Sept 15 2024 . Announcement post is [here](https://x.com/DedPepes_Awaken/status/1835339665081327720).

It sold out on the same day less than two hours after mint began. Announcement post is [here](https://x.com/DedPepes_Awaken/status/1835365332577587670).

It is possible that once 21,000 blocks passed on fractal bitcoin, this collection was the first one to sell out on a popular publicly available minting platform (ie inscribenow.io), posted [here](https://x.com/DedPepes_Awaken/status/1835442129243713750).

It reached the first 100 FB volume on the same day less than 4 hours after it got listed on market. Announcement post is [here](https://x.com/DedPepes_Awaken/status/1836027053038264757).

The collection is now included in the community-run [fractal ecosystem website](https://fractalecosystem.io/projects/dedpepes-awaken) (X account is [@fractaleco](https://x.com/fractaleco)) which lists all the known projects.
