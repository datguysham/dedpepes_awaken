Ded Pepes Awaken is a free-and-fair mint collection inscribed on the Fractal Bitcoin network with a total of 666 32x32 sized assets.

Based on the art by mekong, this is a derivative of the Ded Pepes CC0 Cursed Collection (https://x.com/dedpepes) which can be found on Magic Eden collated by community members (https://magiceden.io/ordinals/marketplace/dedpepes). The discord link for the original collection can be found here (https://discord.gg/PdA8a5mw3d).

Images were downloaded from the official github (https://github.com/DedPepes/CursedDedPepes/tree/main/images) and the colors were individually inverted from the original negative image.

In the spirit of cc0, the Ded Pepes Awaken collection will have the similar license for usage, and will be made available on inscribenow.io, at the limit of 3 mints per transaction.
