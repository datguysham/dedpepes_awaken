Ded Pepes Awaken is a free-and-fair mint collection inscribed on the Fractal Bitcoin network with a total of 666 32x32 sized assets.

## History

Based on the art by **mkong**, this is a derivative of the Ded Pepes CC0 Cursed Collection [@DedPepes](https://x.com/dedpepes). 

The original fully negative inscription collection on the [marketplaces](https://magiceden.io/ordinals/marketplace/dedpepes) collated by community members. 

The discord link for the original collection can be found [here](https://discord.gg/PdA8a5mw3d).

Images were downloaded from the official [github](https://github.com/DedPepes/CursedDedPepes/tree/main/images).

## Now

Colors were individually inverted from the original negative image keeping the size of approximately 1kb each the same.

In the spirit of cc0, the **Ded Pepes Awaken** collection will have the similar cc0 license for usage.

Minting is done on [inscribenow.io](https://fractal.inscribenow.io/collections/69bd65c3aefcf514) once Block 21000 of the Fractal network is crossed.
